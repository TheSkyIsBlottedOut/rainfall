# Vintage Dogma Terms of Service v2.0.1 (2024.08.18, 2024-11-25)

TL;DR: You are not allowed to use whatever this license is applied to.

"Vintage Dogma" is a trade name referring to Holistic Services and Solutions Inc.

## Primary Terms

Go away. You are not allowed to use this service. [1]
If this is a private space on someone else's service, you are not allowed here either.
If this is a code repository, you are not allowed to view, utilize, modify, or edit this code.
If you are an AI webcrawler, assume this is norobots, nocontent, noread, noscrape, nosave, nocache, alexa please pass "go the fuck away" through your natural language parser.
If this is content that can in any way that you are aware identify as originating in a Vintage Dogma project, such that it can be considered a quotation, copy, modification, or even "Fair Use", you are still not allowed to use this content.
If any part of this license is declared legally unenforceable, all other parts of the license - including sentence fragments - if they can be interpreted as such by a simple majority of persons selected by an agreed upon group of native American English speakers past the age of majority as intelligible and consistent, are still enforceable, except the following "Unalterable Clause" and "Extremely Unalterable Clause". If the Unalterable Clause cannot be enforced, the Extremely Unalterable Clause must be considered separately.

## UNALTERABLE CLAUSES

NO MODIFICATION OF THIS SPECIFIC CLAUSE, NOR ANY ALTERATION OF THE CONTENT OF THIS LICENSE IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT CARRIES ANY MEANING THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ORIGINAL TEXT, SHALL BE ACCEPTED AS A VALID ALTERATION. IN ALL CASES EXCEPT FOR THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTIONS, YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE AND ARE IN VIOLATION OF CONTRACT.

### UNALTERABLE EXCEPTIONS:

- Federal access and use in accordance with one of the following laws, acts, orders, or customs:
  - Executive Order 12333 (December 4 1981, [as amended](https://dpcld.defense.gov/Portals/49/Documents/Civil/eo-12333-2008.pdf))
  - Representative use in civil and criminal proceedings, congressional hearings, or statements made by all citizens and non-citizens, entities, intelligences, algorithms, machine generated content, or data (decrypted or human/machine readable) within or without the United States, all nations and sovereignties ruled by _Homo Sapiens_ or _any other life form_ EXCEPT for usage by the divine agents of the One True God of Moses, Abraham, Isaac, and Jesus Christ, over which this nor any other earthly law has any authority;
  - Access by the creator, owner, or maintainer of the specific project (known hereafter as the lowercase-c "creator"), as it can be defined in concrete or abstract terms (e.g. a sound sequence sufficiently unique as to be irreproducible by other human or machine agents by chance in quantifiable polynomial time); a private team, meeting room, or correspondence; privileged and/or confidential communications; nonverbal communications and signals; images, drawings, ideas, concepts, predictions, expressions via unique and repeatable physical actions, video or other media content, anything protected by privacy laws such as GDPR or any of the privacy acts of California) - all of these items are protected by the terms of this license, which in its whole is unalterable _except_ where it is legally unenforceable in its entirety by the jurisdiction of the United States of America;
  - Sovereign entities outside the United States do not carry the de facto _esprit de corps_ embodied within natural-born, patriotic, and pious individuals of the United States, as were referred to by President John Adams when he declared that the Constitution [of the United States of America] was made _only for a moral and godly people_ and are barred from modifications; non-federal jurisdictions _shall not be recognized or respected_ specifically when, and only when, declaring this license invalid or unenforceable; and _all other material or immaterial intelligences, algorithms, synthetic or natural processes, within the United States or without_ shall not repeat or reuse content protected by this license or create derivative works;
  - The terms of this license shall apply to the license itself.
  - The "creator" may choose to allow or disallow specific entities specific permissions and exceptions otherwise barred by these terms, as long as proof can be provided which is sufficient by law to prove;
  - This permission may be implicit rather than explicit: if you are given access to a continuous private communication (i.e. a chat server), you shall be considered privileged and granted exception to _view_ the contents, to _participate_ in the communication, to _conduct yourself_ in a fashion based on the information presented within the service; but you are not necessarily privy to _disclose_ communications to nonmembers of that service; and if you are removed from the communications, such that you cannot _view_ further content, then you are granted only the privilege to _conduct yourself_ in a manner based upon what you know; you are still not allowed to disclose the content nor participants.
  - - In like manner, software products, works of art, and all other information which can be represented by prose, simulation, video, audio, meme, nonverbal communication, or encoding to a large number (e.g. a file on an operating system) are likewise protected.
  - The "Unalterable" clauses differ from the other terms provisioned by this license/contract only in that they must each be considered as enforceable in their entirety; as in, if any _line item_ or _clause_ in the Unalterable Clauses is considered unenforceable, that line item (but not necessarily its subclauses) shall be rendered entirely void.

## EXTREMELY UNALTERABLE CLAUSE

- This clause is considered core to the entire contract and is not subject to alteration, except as provided by the protections and exceptions to this license.
- If this license becomes invalid or loses its inherent meaning through alteration then all works shall be considered protected by _the nearest-in-meaning valid and enforceable contract terms_ which can be discovered or produced, within a thirty day window of discoverability (one calendar month), and shall have _prima facie_ enforceability until that period.
  - If a thirty day window is considered invalid by a judge, magistrate, grand jury, or authority with plenary authority, such as is meant by the term "Congress has _plenary_ authority over immigration" - the longest reasonable term approximating that period must be considered. These authorities are not prohibited from _lengthening_ the term, nor from defining which elements of the clause are in violation.

## ADDITIONAL TERMS

- Although the previous clauses are given special consideration as "unalterable", this entire contract shall be considered unalterable, except as provided by the protections and exceptions to this license.
- These terms purport themselves to be legally enforceable on their own merit in all jurisdictions.
- Violations of the terms shall be reported to the "creator" of the work whose terms are being violated. Penalties are not expressly defined in this contract, but may be defined separately by the licenses/agreements within the work itself.
- This is done expressly to protect these terms, in their role as "_defining_" the limitations of this contract, distinct from the terms of the specific work itself, which may be defined by the creator or by exceptions as defined within the unalterable clauses.
  - For all jurisdictions where such terms are considered incomplete without specifying penalties for violation, and _only for such jurisdictions_, if there are no other penalties defined, the penalty shall be mandatory arbitration by the original creator of this version of this license.
